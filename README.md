# Student Programming Performance Analysis

This notebook contains analysis and predictions related to student programming performance. It utilizes two datasets: "Predict.csv" and "MainTable.csv" located in the "DataChallenge v1.1" folder.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone or download the repository containing the IPython Notebook and the datasets to your local machine.
   
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the notebook and datasets are located.
   
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/repository
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. It's recommended to use a virtual environment.
   
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Data Setup**:
   - Create a folder named "DataChallenge v1.1" in the root directory if it doesn't exist already.
   - Place the datasets "Predict.csv" and "MainTable.csv" inside the "DataChallenge v1.1" folder.

## Running the Notebook

1. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**: Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt to start the Jupyter Notebook server.
   
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Access the Notebook**: Once the server starts, it will open your default web browser. Navigate to the directory where the notebook is located and click on "Student_Programming_Performance.ipynb" to open it.

3. **Execute Cells**: Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially by pressing `Shift + Enter` or by clicking on `Run` in the toolbar.

4. **Follow Instructions**: Follow the instructions within the notebook to perform analysis and predictions on the datasets.

## Additional Notes

- **Python Version**: Ensure you're using a compatible Python version as specified in the requirements or the notebook itself.
- **Dataset**: If you wish to use different datasets, ensure they are compatible with the notebook's code or make necessary modifications.
